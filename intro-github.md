# Introduction to GitHub

## Create a GitHub account

1. Go to <https://github.com>
2. Click the "Sign up" button
3. Enter your email and create a username and password to complete the sign up process

## Create a GitHub Repository
1. Make sure you're logged in to your account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Scroll to the top of the [foundations-github](https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-github/) repository and click the green "Use This Template" button (appears on the right side above the code area)
3. This brings you to a "Create a new repository" form. Follow these steps:
    - **Enter your new repository name**. Use a lowercase name without spaces or odd characters.
    - Choose "Public" repository.
    - Leave the "Include all branches" option **Unchecked**! (you do not want all branches, only the main/master branch)
    - Click on the green button "**Create repository from template**." This will take you to your new repository.

## Edit README file

## Add a New File

## Check Out the Repository's History

## Turn on GitHub Pages

1. On your project repository's home page, click the "Settings" button (appears on the right along the tabs above the code area).
2. On "Settings" page: click "Pages" in the left side menu.
3. On the "Pages" page: in the "Source" section, change the dropdown button from "none" to "main" (leave the folder option as "/root"), then click the "Save" button. 

Once saved, the page will refresh with an alert providing the URL where your site will appear. 
It will take a few minutes for the build to happen and your site to go live--so wait it out! 

Meanwhile, you'll want to copy the URL to display on your home page:

1. Copy the provided URL.
2. Go to repository's home page.
3. On right side of the code area, look for "About" section and click on the cog icon to edit. 
4. In the "About" box, paste in your URL, then click "Save". This will make it easy to access the site in the future!

## Make an Issue

## Optional: Add a GitHub Collaborator

Most digital projects are collaborative, so you will probably want to add your collaborators to your GitHub project repository.

1. On the repository home page, click "Settings" tab
2. On left side nav, click "Manage access"
3. Click the green "invite teams or people" button
4. Type in a GitHub user name to add. The search bar will show suggestions based on what you type, select the correct account to add.
5. Select their level of access to the repository. Generally if you want people to be able to edit code in the repository, give them "Write" access. Then click the green "Add" button.

Once added your collaborator will receive an email with the invitation to join your repository.
They will have to confirm the invitation before being added!
